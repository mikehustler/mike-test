I use tag classes like this:

For the issue type I have:

type:bug
type:feature
type:invalid
For issue priorities I use:

prio:low
prio:normal
prio:high
And for an issue's states I use:

status:confirmed
status:deferred
status:fix-committed
status:in-progress
status:incomplete
status:rejected
status:resolved
For additionaly informational tags I prefix them with info like this:

info:feedback-needed
You could also introduce version tags like this:

ver:1.x
ver:1.1
etc.
Maybe this gives you an idea of how this could work.
